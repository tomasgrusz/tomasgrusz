Hiya! <img width="16" src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/82398-oh_waveq/download"></img>. Iâ€™m [Tom](https://grusz.dev/), a frontend architect & software engineer based in Prague.

ðŸŽ¨ I believe the bridge between designers and developers is crucial. I work to strengthen it, delving into both worlds to create better products. I bring 3D design to the web, blending visual art with code - a skill not many embrace yet.

ðŸŒ² Outside of [my projects](https://grusz.dev/#portfolio), I find inspiration in caring for my dog, gardening, and aquascaping - cultivating small ecosystems. Gaming keeps my imagination sharp and playful. My ideal workspace is a cozy, near-forest retreat: natural wood, dark green and black, close to nature for endless inspiration.

ðŸ§‹ Fuelled by matcha, oolong, or jasmine tea.
