Hiya <img width="16" src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/82398-oh_waveq/download"></img>! I’m **Tom**, a frontend architect and software engineer based in Prague, with years of dev experience at [Mastercard](https://mastercard.com) and [Make](https://make.com).

🎨 I believe the bridge between designers and developers is crucial. I work to strengthen it, jumping into both worlds to create better products by applying 3D, visual art, and code - a skill not many embrace yet.

🧋 Fuelled by matcha, oolong, and jasmine tea.
